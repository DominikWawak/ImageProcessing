# Image Processing
Picking fruit out of an image and counting clusters.

The code is in the master branch!

This was a college data structures assignment that got me interested in image processing and vision systems.

This assignment scored 95%.

Here is how it works: 

* The user can pick a image and select what color the friut is.
* The user is also able to manage the sizes of disjoint sets and the outliers of how far apart the pixels have to be.
* To do his the image needs to be made black and white.
